                                world-class infrastructure and affordable fees. Most of the universities in China are
                                state owned; however only some offer a full English medium program.</p>

                                    conditions as well as the type of diseases are very similar among the two nations.
                                    So, China is one of the most preferred country to study MBBS abroad. Students from
                                    India are going to study MBBS in China since several years. In fact, we at IEC Prince,
                                    have been recommending Chinese medical universities since 2006.

                                <p>All Medical Colleges and Universities in China are owned by the Government (state).
                                    This ensures that the quality of education as well as the standards are never put at
                                    stake for making profits. There are a number of medical universities in China, which
