                                        Students with 50% marks in PCB can also take admission in MBBS in Georgia. The
                                        universities focus on skill building and as long as the students have a
                                        reasonable understanding and interest in the world of medicine, they will blend
                                        with the course very well.</p>

                <h2 class="ml-title-line-2 theme-red">Comparison with Russia and Ukraine</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="crs-pra">
                <p class="crs-first-pra"> Many agents are spreading false information about Georgia. This is because
                    they do not have
                    collaboration with MBBS universities in Georgia. Hence, they defame MBBS study in Georgia so that
                    they
                    can send the students to the Ukraine or Russia. However, by facts, Georgia is a much better
                    destination
                    for Medical Studies than Russia or Ukraine.</p>

                <p class="crs-first-pra"> The majority of universities in Russia offer a bilingual medical course.
                    However, their agents in India
                    do not pass on this information to the students. So, the students who go Russia are taught in the
                    Russian language for the last 3 years of the MBBS course. This affects the understanding of the
                    students
                    and they fail to grasp the information properly.</p>

                <p class="crs-first-pra"> Similarly, medical universities in Ukraine have a low educational standard.
                    Professors of the
                    Universities ask for money from the students to pass them to the next semester. This allows for
                    students
                    to clear their exams without studying. Students who can afford to pay to the professors clear their
                    exams without studying. Hence, this kills the motivation to study in the students.</p>

                <p class="crs-first-pra"> There is also tension between Russia and Ukraine making the locations unfit
                    and unsafe for students.
                    Unless the problems amongst Russia and Ukraine gets resolved, we advise Indian students to not risk
                    by
                    proceeding with medical studies over there.</p>

                <p class="crs-first-pra"><strong></strong> Conclusion:</strong> Georgia is a much better destination for
                    MBBS studies. The educational quality in Georgia is
                    unmatched by the likes of Russia and Ukraine. In fact, after China, Georgia is the 2nd best
                    destination
                    to study MBBS.</p></div>
